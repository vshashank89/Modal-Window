// Handling KeyPress Events ('Esc') :
// 1. Keyboard events are so-called 'global-events' , because they do NOT happen on one specific element. 
// 2 . So for global(keyboard) events we listen on the entire document.
// 3. So by using 'document.addEventListener' we are listening for the event everywhere , no matter where it happens on the page.
//4. There are 3 types of events for the keyboard : 
// a) keydown : this is fired as soon as we press down the key once
// b) keypress : is fired continuously as we keep our finger on certain key.
// c) keyup : This happens only when we lift our finger off the key. 

// 5. how to know which key is pressed ?
// a) When any key is pressed , a keydown event is generated.
// b) When an event like this happens , Javascript in fact generates an object which contains all the information about the event.
// c) javascript allows to access that object in the event handler function , So we should give the function a parameter / Ex:function(e) e for event /
// d) As soon as the event occurs , javascript will call this function with the event object as an argument.
